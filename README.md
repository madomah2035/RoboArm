**Project Name: RoboArm**

# This is a miniature project to showcase remotely the power of programming in automation and robotics.

*The Robotic Arm Simulator(**RoboArm**) is a virtual model of a robotic arm designed to demonstrate key principles of mechatronics, including motion control, kinematics, and automation. The simulator allows users to control the movement of a multi-jointed robotic arm in real-time using input methods such as sliders, buttons, or even basic code. It visually represents how actuators and linkages work together to perform tasks like picking and placing objects.
This project showcases an understanding of mechanical systems, electronics integration, and programming logic, offering a practical preview of how robotic systems are developed and tested before physical implementation. It serves as an ideal demonstration of Musah ADOMAHâ€™s passion for combining mechanical engineering and intelligent systems, aligning with his vision to create real-world robotic solutions*
